# Hemant Trauma Centre Website - User Guide

Welcome to your new website! This document explains how the website works and what features are ready for you to use.

## 🌟 What the Website Does Now
Your website is designed to be fast, easy for patients to use, and professional.

### 1. Bilingual Support (Hindi & English)
Patients can switch between Hindi and English with a single click. This ensures everyone in your community can understand the services you provide.

### 2. Easy Appointments
We have a "2-Step Patient Form." Instead of overwhelming patients with one long form, they enter their basic details first, then their message. This is proven to increase the number of people who actually complete the form.

### 3. Patient Tracking (Admin Dashboard)
You have a private "Management Area" where you can see every patient who has requested an appointment.
- **Access**: Go to `/admin`.
- **Login**: Enter your secure Admin Key. The system will keep you logged in for **2 hours**.
- **Live Updates**: The dashboard automatically checks for new appointments every minute. You'll see a green "Live Updates" dot when connected.
- **Tracking**: You can mark if a patient has been called (**Contacted**) and if they have visited (**Visited**).
- **Search**: You can instantly search by Name, Mobile Number (last 4 digits), or Email.

### 4. Smart Staff Alerts
Whenever a new patient submits a form, the website automatically prepares an email alert.
- **Batching**: To avoid cluttering your inbox, we send one summary email every **15 minutes** (if new leads exist).
- **Autonomous**: This happens automatically in the background, even if you don't have the dashboard open.

### 5. Smart Success Screen
After booking, patients see a confirmation screen with one-touch buttons for calling or navigation.

### 6. Fast Contact Tools
- **One-Touch buttons**: Inside the secure Admin Dashboard, you can click "Call" or "WhatsApp" to immediately contact the patient.

### 7. Managing Test Data (Secret Delete)
If you need to remove test appointments:
1.  **Activate Mode**: **Double-click** or **Long-press (5s)** the "Hemant Trauma Centre" logo at the top of the dashboard.
2.  **Delete**: A red banner will appear. Click the **Trash Icon** on any card to remove it.
3.  **Archive**: To permanently clean up deleted items from the database, click the **"ARCHIVE TRASH"** button in the red banner.

## 🛠️ Planned Future Features
We have built the "foundation" for several extra features:

1. **Patient Receipts**: Automatically sending an email to the patient to confirm we received their request.
2. **Detailed Hospital Map**: An interactive map to help users find the location.
3. **Gallery/Photos**: A section to showcase facilities.

3. **Check Appointments**: Go to the `/admin` page once a day to see new patient requests.
4. **Respond Fast**: Use the buttons in your email to call or text the patient within 15-30 minutes.
